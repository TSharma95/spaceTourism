## Overview

I used **Vanilla javascript** to change the content of the pages by fetching the data from the `json` local file
```js
eleId.textContent = jsonData[idField];
```

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
